\section{The IceCube Experiment}
\label{sec:The_IceCube_Experiment}
The IceCube experiment is located in the antarctic and consists of a huge array of photomultiplier inside the ice. 
It's goal is the measurement of origin and energy of astrophysical neutrinos.
The experiment is subdivided into the in-ice array, DeepCore, and IceTop. 
This subdivision is due to the different densities of photomultiplier on a cable. 
The DeepCore for example has the highest photomultiplier density and allows for measurements in a lower energy 
range (\qty{10}{\giga\eV}), where as the in-ice array limit lays around \qty{100}{\giga\eV}.
Additionally the IceTop, positioned above the DeepCore and the in-ice array, 
is used as a shower detector and simultaneously as a veto for Conventional neutrinos.
In total 5160 photomultiplier are placed at a depth of 1450 - 2450\,\unit{\meter}. 
These are used in order to measure the Cherenkov light emitted by charged particles exceeding the speed of light inside the medium it is traversing. \\

Since neutrinos only interact via the weak interaction a direct measurement is basically imposable. 
Therefore the IceCube experiment looks for particles created by weak interactions of the neutrinos. 
In this case through charged and neutral currents (CC and NC) as seen in \autoref{eq:CC} (CC) and \autoref{eq:NC} (NC).
\begin{align}
	\barparen{\nu_l} + A &= l^\mp + X \label{eq:CC}\\
	\nu_l + A &= \nu_l + X \label{eq:NC}	
\end{align}
Leptons created in CC are detected using the shape of the signature they leave in the detector. 
Electronic signals appear round whereas the signal generated by neutrinos 
are longer as they loose tier energy slower than an electron. 
Tau signatures are harder to detect as they generate two round signals, 
one from the fast decaying tau, the second form the electron generated from the tau decay.
Particles from NC, are detected by cascades created from hadronic particles, 
which leave a signature similar to the electronic one.\\
